# hybrid-recommendation-system
The primary focus of my work is on the deployment and evaluation of two fundamental models; the collaborative filtering model and the content-based recommendation model. In the collaborative filtering, the singular value decomposition library (SVD) was used to uncover latent patterns and relationships within user-item interations, contributing to more accurate and personalized recommendations. This model is an integral aspect of the hybrid recommendation system. On the other hand, the content-based recommendation model employing the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF) vectorizer focuses on understanding and recommending items based on their inherent features an characteristics. To facilitate seamless user interactions and enhance the overall user experience, the Graphical Interface (GI) was developed using the pheonix framework. The interface serves as the user's gateway to the recommendation system, providing an intuitive and user-friendly platformn for exploring and receiving personalized recommendations. To ensure acurate evaluation in the analysis of each models used, the collaborative filtering utilized two metrics: the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) which validated the model's ability to accurately predict user-item interactions and generate meaningful recommendations.
